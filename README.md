RedisChat
=========

__COSC416A - Special Topics in Database Systems__

This is the assignment and answer key for part III of the Redis assignment.
In this section, you will create a basic chat client using Redis.
When working, your client should be able to talk to other clients on the server.
Check out `index.php` for information on what files you have to modify.
Each file will explain the relevant schema and what you need to do.
Sections where you need to add Redis commands are marked with TODOs.
